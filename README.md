### My favorite place in the world is New Zealand<br>
*New Zealand* One of the "*most unpolluted countries in the world" where spectacularscenary bounds. 90% of immigrants state that they would certaily "recommend the land of kiwis to their families and friends.*" <br>New Zealanders get generous leave benifits so they have plenty of time to enjoy the landscape and sports facilities.
